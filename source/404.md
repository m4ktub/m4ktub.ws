Once upon a time there was this page in a far far way
web site. This page was the pinacle of perfection, a clean
mirror that shined with all that is perfect in <em>da
interwebz</em>. The legion of "first" comments and lolcatz
where obsfuscated with such radiance and kept away...

...and it was lost. The address that once got you there
is broken. All the secrets of the universe are lost with it
and you have to start over.

Try the [main page](/). It is as good a place as any to start.

**Good luck**.
