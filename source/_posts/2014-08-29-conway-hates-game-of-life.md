While reading the news feed I've come across this video entitled "Does John
Conway Hate His Game of Life?". I was obviously interested because it is very
recent and, although the Game of Life fascinated me from early on, I never read
much about the creator or what was being mathematically proven with it. Also,
the title worked, for me. How can such a popular achievement not be a motive of
pride. Well... the video covers that. Enjoy!

It's curious that this video is one of the few times I've seen the man
itself. The game interests me conceptually, for the idea itself. The
mathematical part of it, and the people involved, is also interesting but stops
being a game really quickly. :)
