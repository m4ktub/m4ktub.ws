So a few days ago Eric Schmidt wrote [a piece in The New York Times][1] were he suggests 
leaders  and companies should control how other people can use the internet ... to help 
them be better, more informed, and free-minded people. The expression that is getting some 
traction is suggestion that we should build tools "sort of like spell-checkers, but for 
hate".

It's very dangerous tough. There is a huge difference between letting people find their 
way and preventing people from ever getting lost. In the first case you provide tools that
allow people to get where they want to go. In the second case you never allow people to 
reach unfamiliar places.

Consider the expression "spell-checker [...] for hate" and the mindset behind it. A spell 
checker checks if what you are writing is correct or not. Obviously you are not the one 
entitled to make that decision. After all, that's the situation we have now. And hey, if 
standard spell-checkers come with a centrally defined dictionary, why can't hate 
spell-checkers come with a central definition of appropriate language. Once you give that 
step, you have a thought police somewhere. I doesn't matter if it's *Google Department for 
Hate Prevention* or the *International Office of Customs and Language because*, at that 
moment, someone is trying to prevent you from getting lost.

Today "all Muslims are fucking terrorists" is hateful speech, tomorrow "we demand  
elections" is promoting violence, next week "we need a choice" creates unnecessary 
anxiety. Censorship assumes many forms. *We'll use power over everyone for the common good* 
is one of the most typical. *Trust us, we're the good guys* the best argument.
