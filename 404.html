Once upon a time there was this page in a far far way 
web site. This page was the pinacle of perfection, a clean
mirror that shined with all that is perfect in <em>da
interwebz</em>. The legion of "first" comments and lolcatz
where obsfuscated with such radiance and kept away...
</p>
<p>
...and it was lost. The address that once got you there
is broken. All the secrets of the universe are lost with it 
and you have to start over. 
</p>
<p>
Try the <a href="/">main page</a>. It is as good a place as
any to start.
</p>
<p>
Good luck.
