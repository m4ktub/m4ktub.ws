          <p>I’m a software engineer living in Portugal. My brother initiated me in the art
of programming. My academic education gave me knowledge about computer science
and information systems engineering. My day-to-day work introduces me to
enterprise information management systems. And my curiosity makes me learn about
everything else.</p>
<p>This blog is a way of persisting ideas, research, and experiments in a more
consistent and structured way. Most things will be related to computers or
programming in some way. Lately also about the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bitcoincash.org/">Bitcoin Cash</a> rabbit hole.</p>
<h2 id="In-the-beginning-the-earth-was-void-and-without-form-…-a-little-latter"><a href="#In-the-beginning-the-earth-was-void-and-without-form-…-a-little-latter" class="headerlink" title="In the beginning the earth was void and without form … a little latter"></a>In the beginning the earth was void and without form … a little latter</h2><p>I’ve started to be interested in computers and programming in a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> 128K. The Spetrum was mostly for gaming but some lines,
squares, and circles where created with BASIC. Most of my programming experiments
started in a 33 Mhz 386 PC with Turbo Pascal.</p>
<p>The initial programs asked your name and produced a scripted output with colored
messages, and progress indicators, for fun. Later programs where a little more
complex. I wish I still had my lander implementation which featured procedural
terrain (just a zig zag at the bottom), configurable gravity force, sprite
animation, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Music_File">CMF</a> sounds for burner activation, crashes and successful
landings. Much more fun making it than playing the damn thing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/about-lander.png" alt="Amazing Graphics!"></p>
<p>Off course it was a mess of Pascal and assembly code but at the end of that
period I already had great concern for the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://xkcd.com/276/">correct alignment</a> of
code. Eventually I was presented to cellular automatons and, in particular, to
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>. It was very simple to understand and
fascinating. It represented what I liked about programming. Very simple rules can
produce very complex, unpredictable, and life-like structures.</p>
<h2 id="Learning-languages-and-thinking-meta"><a href="#Learning-languages-and-thinking-meta" class="headerlink" title="Learning languages and thinking meta"></a>Learning languages and thinking <em>meta</em></h2><p>So I’ve learned and experimented with a few programming languages for an hobby.
Making sense of all the different programs, languages, and patterns made me start
to see things in a more conceptual level: the meta level of programming. I still
remember by hearth how I initiated VGA 320x200 graphics mode within a Pascal
program. It was a piece of assembly.</p>
<figure class="highlight x86asm"><figcaption><span>Initialize VGA 320x200 graphics mode</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mv  <span class="built_in">ax</span>, <span class="number">13h</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="number">10h</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Those initial constructs are still applied but are under several layers of
software. Nowadays there is a little too many moving parts to know them all by
hearth. So I try to think about the individual responsibilities of components,
how they interact, and the properties of that interaction. Languages that allow
to express different concepts like sound or images directly are very
interesting. Reinventing drag-and-drop for the fourth time in a Web OS not so
much.</p>
<h2 id="Having-fun"><a href="#Having-fun" class="headerlink" title="Having fun"></a>Having fun</h2><p>Nevertheless most things related with programming are fun for me. Be it micro, 
macro, infra, or meta some things are just made for fun, like all those little 
hello worlds or, in my case, the various implementations of the Game of Life 
like <a href="/posts/2014/08/12/game-of-life-experiment/#experiment">the first experiment here</a>.</p>
